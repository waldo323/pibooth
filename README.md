pibooth
=======

pibooth is a work in progress :)

the idea behind the project is to have a Raspberry Pi run a photobooth

  - initially using the raspberry pi module
  - possibly an extension of this project will be to work with usb webcam and dslr cameras...
    - this could then work on beaglebones, laptops etc
