pibooth
=======

pibooth is a work in progress :)

the idea behind the project is to have a Raspberry Pi run a photobooth

current requirements:
  - raspberry pi (I am using B rev 2 and hope to test on rev 1 at some point)
  - raspberry pi camera module
  - momentary button
  - resistors for the button (I'll add which ones I am using later)
  - leds (optional at this point)



  - initially using the raspberry pi module
  - possibly an extension of this project will be to work with usb webcam and dslr cameras...
    - this could then work on beaglebones, laptops etc
